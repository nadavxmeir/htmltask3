                  <p>
                    We are Nadav and Noam, the creative duo behind Yummi's
                    Bakery. As best friends and co-owners, we share a deep
                    passion for the culinary arts. We are the cooks in the
                    kitchen, personally crafting every item on our menu to
                    ensure that our friendship and love for food go into
                    everything we serve.

                  <h4>When.</h4>
                  <p>
                    Our journey began in 2019, shortly after we first met. We
                    quickly discovered that we shared the exact same dream: to
                    create a place where people could enjoy real food. That
                    shared passion turned into reality, and we have been serving
                    our community ever since.

                  <p>
                    Our soul is dedicated to bringing people together through
                    the power of comfort food. At Yummi's, we don't just stick
                    to one style; we pride ourselves on offering the best food
                    variety in town. From savory breads to sweet pastries, we
                    have something to satisfy every craving.

                    Our secret to quality is simple: everything is handmade with
                    genuine love and passion for the craft. We don't cut
                    corners. We are up before the sun, baking fresh every single
                    morning to ensure that perfection is baked into every crust,
                    crumb, and slice before you walk in the door.
